# PeirceLines
C++ program that simulates students entering a Pierce cafeteria with multiple food lines. The program uses queues to manage the lines and simulates student arrivals using a Poisson distribution. The simulation runs for one hour, and you can customize parameters such as the number of food lines, time spent at the head of each line, and the total number of students.
